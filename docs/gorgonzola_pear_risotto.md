# Gorgonzola-Pear Risotto

## Ingredients

For 4 people:

- 2 cups of rice for risotto
- 2/3 cups of crumbled gorgonzola cheese
- 4 minipers
- 1 onion
- 1 liter of homemade vegetable broth
- Broth of 1 lime
- 2 tbsp of butter/ghee
- Optional: parmesan cheese to taste
- Olive oil to taste
- Salt and ground pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Take a pot with the vegetable broth to the high heat. When it boils, lower the heat and keep warm throughout the risotto preparation.
1. While the broth warms up, do the pre-preparate: peel and thin pike the onion. Wash the pears under running water and keep the shell. Cut 2 of pears in cubes of 1 cm – discard the cabho and seeds. Transfer the cubes to a bowl and water with the lime broth, reserve. Cut the other pear into rooms, keeping the cabin.
1. Bring a pan, preferably non-stick, to the medium fire. When heating, water with a drizzle of olive oil, place the pear rooms with the part cut down and let it be soared for 2 minutes on each side. Book a plate while preparing the risotto.
1. Bring an average pan to medium heat. When heating, drizzle with 1 tablespoon (soup) of olive oil, add the onion, season with a pinch of salt and sauté until it dries. Add the rice and mix well for 1 minute to wrap all the grains with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste – remember that homemade broth does not carry salt.
1. Drep with the wine and stir well until dry. Add a vegetable broth shell and stir again until the rice absorbs the broth. Repeat the process, adding the broth, from shell to shell, until risotto stays on point: the grain must be cooked, but still hard in the center. In the latter addition, do not let dry completely – the risotto should get moist.
1. Turn off the heat, mix the butter, the gorgonzola cheese and parmesan cheese to taste. Add the pear in cubes (with the lemon broth) and gently stir so as not to dismantle. Divide the risotto into four dishes, have 2 pieces of grilled pear in the center of each and serve to follow.

Note: If you want to give another layer of texture, sprinkle a little more fresh gorgonzola cheese on the risotto when serving.
