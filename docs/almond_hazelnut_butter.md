# Almond-hazelnut butter

## Ingredients

* 250g / 2 cups raw unsalted almonds
* 250g / 2 cups raw unsalted hazelnuts
* 2 tsp organic cocoa powder
* 2 tbsp coconut oil
* Optional 1/2 tsp cinnamon - we used 1 tsp and was too much
* Optional vanilla drops / beans - we use some drops
* Optional 1/4 tsp sea salt - we didn't use

Note: mixing baked almonds with a bit of  raw almonds can enhace flavor profile where toasted nuts taste smokier, nuttier, whereas raw nuts tend to be a little bit more on the sweet side. So try to mix things up a little to achieve the desired flavor and consistency (https://thehealthyfoodie.com/toasted-almond-hazelnut-butter/). Eg.: use 50% almonds raw and 50% toasted
100% hazelnuts toasted and without skin

## Instructions

1. clean the almonds with water; dry them; and inspect for shells in a baking tray, if you spot any remove them.
1. pre-heat the oven at 175 Â°C.

1. in the same baking tray, put the hazelnuts on a separate side (the separation will help peeling hazelnuts later).
1. roast for 12 min (MAX more than that was not good) next time.
1. cool for 5 min and transfer to a kitchen towel.
1. remove skins of hazelnuts - or 80% at least.
1. put the ingredients and nuts in a food processor and mix for for some minutes / you can stop and use a spatula to not overheat your processor.
