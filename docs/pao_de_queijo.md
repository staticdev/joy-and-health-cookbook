# Brazilian's pão de queijo

## Ingredients

Per person:

* 1 cup of Gouda cheese (or vegan Gouda)
* 1 cup of Tapioca flour
* 1 tbsp of Parmigiano-Reggiano (also works with Grana or vegan Parmigiano)
* 1/2 egg (optional)
* 30-35% heavy cream (if you are using an egg you can use water instead)
* Oregano
* Salt

## Instructions

1. Put the cheeses and flour in a food processor and optionally the egg.
1. Add oregano, salt and other spices to taste.
1. Add carefully heavy cream/water until the dough turn into a ball. Do not make the dough too wet since you need to roll.
1. Roll in smaller balls and put into a tray.
1. Optional: for better looking balls freeze the balls for 30 minutes.
1. Pre-heat the oven at 180 °C.
1. Bake for 25 minutes.
