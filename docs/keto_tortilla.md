# Keto tortilla

## Ingredients

- 1 cup almond flour
- 3 tbsp coconut flour
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tbsp water
- 2 tsp xanthan gum
- 2 tsp apple cider vinegar or lime juice
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt

## Instructions

1. In a food processor, combine almond flour, coconut flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Pulse until thoroughly combined.
1. With the food processor running, pour in apple cider vinegar, followed by the egg, and then the water. Stop the food processor once the dough forms into a ball. The dough will be sticky to touch.
1. Wrap the dough in cling film and knead it for a minute or two through the plastic. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes (or up to three days in the fridge).
1. Heat up a skillet or pan over medium heat. Break the dough into eight 1" balls (26g each) and roll out between two sheets of parchment or waxed paper until each round is 5-inches in diameter.
1. Transfer the tortillas to the skillet and cook over medium heat for just 3-6 seconds. Flip them over immediately and continue to cook until just lightly golden on each side, 30 to 40 seconds. Don't overcook them, as they will no longer be pliable or puff up.
1. Keep the tortillas warm wrapped in a kitchen cloth until serving. To rewarm, heat briefly on both sides, until just warm (less than a minute).
1. These tortillas are best eaten straight away, but you can store the dough in the fridge for up to three days or freeze the tortillas for up to three months.

Note: you can eat it with [taco toppings](taco_toppings.md).

Note: **very important** when cooking, coconut flour burns rather rapidly. So while this does help you to get the traditional charred marks of flour tortillas, you do need to keep an eye out for them to keep them from burning. Having said that, you do want your skillet to be very hot in order for the tortillas to cook quickly (in under a minute) and stay pliable. Like any tortilla, if the heat is not high enough it will harden and crack.
